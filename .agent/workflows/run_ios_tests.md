description: Run the full iOS test suite using the optimized script
---
To run the iOS tests (Unit Tests) locally, always use the optimized script that handles serial execution and UI test skipping.

1. Ensure the script is executable (just in case) and run it.
// turbo
chmod +x Scripts/test_ios.sh && ./Scripts/test_ios.sh
